# Milestone 1: Project Outline

## Project: Business Website
Create a four-page website for a business including (Home, Contact, Browse, and Product). Follow the provided graphic design to accomplish the site's HTML and CSS. Each page should have a header and a footer (which is the same header/footer for all three pages). Take advantage of PHP includes so the header and footer are created once for the project and are included onto each of the three pages. Use background image from subtlepatters.com for the background. 

## Browse Page
The browse page will list several products as links. Each link will have a GET variable indicating its product name and will pass this variable to the product page when clicked. Pass a numeric value (1 for Mac, 2 for Ubuntu, and 3 for Windows) for the variable. The product page will use `if` and `if-else` statements to determine which product was clicked. An output should be displayed which shows the name of the product clicked.

Files that need to be created:
- index.php
- contact.php
- browse.php
- product.php
- header.php
- footer.php
- images/background.png
- css/styles.css
