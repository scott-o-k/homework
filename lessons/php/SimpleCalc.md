# SimpleCalc: Week1
Over the course of several steps, create a php program that will read 1 or 2 numbers and an operator from the querystring and then return an html page page that shows the problem and the answer. For example URLs I'm going to assume that you are in your localhost environment and that your php file is called calc.php. So an example URL will look like: http://localhost/calc.php?n1=3&n2=5&opp=add

## Step 1: Print out the inputs
Given the example URL above your program should output a page that looks like:
```
Number 1: 3
Number 2: 5
Operator: add
```
### Hints
- don't get fancy or clever. Do **only** the minimum work to satisfy each step.

## Step 2: Implement the add operator
Add the two inputs and display the result. Example output:
```
Number 1: 3
Number 2: 5
Operator: add
Result: 8
```
### Hints
- no if-statement is necessary yet since "add" is the only operator. (This derives from the first hint)
